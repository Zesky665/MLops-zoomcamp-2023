## Stages of MLOps

### Design
What is the problem that we want to solve?
Find/create dataset?
### Train
Experiment, try to create  a model.
### Operate
Take model and apply it to problems.

## MLOps Concepts

### Experiment tracking
Rapid iteration with model changes. Each experimentn needs to be tracked and iterated upon.

### Training Pipeline
Pipeline for training models, datasets, models, connected to previous concept. 

### Deployment
How to make the model available for use. Depends of the type of data it uses, btach vs Stream.

### Module registry
Catalog of models that can be deploymed. 

### Monitoring
Monitoring of the deployed model, in order to track the performance and accuracy of the deployed mode.
